    Hello, Nasser. Thanks for the note. Your compiling-to-categories ideas both sound excellent to me, and I’m very sorry that your PhD environment was unable to support you exploring either. As exploration topics, we could certainly get into homomorphic encryption and/or ADS. Reformulating LambdaAuth denotationally and as a category could make for exactly the sort of comparison I’d like to support. I imagine we could get to the heart of the matter much more simply than with operational and linguistic formulations. If so, the simplifications may suggest useful insights and improvements.  Since you’re nearly finished with your PhD, we probably don’t want to distract you too much at this point. I worry about feeding your discontent with your present topic, making it more difficult for you to finish. What sort of timing do you expect for finishing up, and what post-completion plans or desires do you have?  With best wishes, - Conal

    Hi mate, yeah I remember you. Want to work in Brisbane? Add me as a reference if you like.  Maybe you can get a longer visa at a time in the future?  I am working on aviation software at the moment. I am looking to hire some people help me out with building a FP lab in Brisbane. We will be working on mostly open-source software.

    Dear Nasser, Thanks for getting in touch with me. Your ideas are potentially exciting and interesting ones, and I’ve talked with other people about Co-dfns’ role in the blockchain space before, but things didn’t go anywhere. The Co-dfns project has always been intended to provide a suitable commercial and research bed for further research and development in the space of APL. The hope is that Co-dfns would be able to provide a significant framework both for writing compilers, but also for doing APL research in the future since some of the basic elements are handled for you already. I have spent only a small amount of time studying smart contracts, so my expertise there is limited. Perhaps I can best answer your question by having a chat over Skype or the like with you at some convenient time for you? I think that would enable me to best figure out what your focus is and what resources I could best recommend to you. Are you available for a Skype chat at some point? What times work for you?  Yours truly, Aaron W. Hsu

    Nasser Alzahrani, Thank you very much for your kind words.  Your email, and a few others like it, make my work worthwhile. The only work I know of on my kind of FM for low level languages is the PhD thesis of my former student Theodore Norvell, now a prof at Memorial University theo@mun.ca.  He can direct you to the relevant published papers.  I wish you well in your endeavor to verify stack machine code.  Cheers and thank you, Eric Hehner

    Hello Nasser, How are you? I am so thankful for your review! It's a very flattering review, thank you for that! I don't think I need to edit it at all!  I need to brush off some things and then I'll publish your review next to the book! I'm embarrassed to say I might take a while, but I will use your review when the polishing is done.  Thank you so much for the paper, it will come in handy to prepare some Python code to implement a convolutional neural network hehe.  All the best, Rodrigo
