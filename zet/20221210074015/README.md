# To plant a Salvadora persica tree indoors, follow these steps:

- Choose a container that is large enough to accommodate the tree's root system and has drainage holes to allow excess water to drain out. A container that is at least 12 inches in diameter and 12 inches deep should be sufficient for a small Salvadora persica tree.
- Fill the container with a well-draining potting soil that is rich in organic matter. Salvadora persica trees prefer a slightly alkaline soil with a pH of 7.5 to 8.5.
- Carefully remove the tree from its current pot, taking care not to damage the roots. If the roots are tightly packed, gently loosen them with your fingers to encourage new growth.
- Place the tree in the center of the container, and fill in around the roots with the potting soil. Press down gently to remove any air pockets, and water the soil until it is evenly moist.
- Place the container in a location that receives plenty of sunlight, such as a south-facing window. Salvadora persica trees need at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day to thrive.
- Water the tree regularly, keeping the soil evenly moist but not soggy. Avoid over-watering, as this can cause the roots to rot.
- With proper care and attention, your Salvadora persica tree should thrive indoors and provide you with fresh miswak sticks for natural dental care.
